Creating a custom library to make http requests using AJAX with callback functions

# 2-9-2020 (7:30pm) {
  I watched a whole tutorial about this and built a part of it and i'm honestly pretty lost as to how exactly this works. I get what it does and why I would use it but I need to see this a few more times I think to learn more about callbacks and AJAX..

  Ok, i'm about to go at this again. I'm going to take it from the top and try and go all the way through, i'm not opposed to doing it over and over untill I get it either so it probably wont be my last time doing this exercise.

  Alright, I just completed going over this again and I get it a lot more now. I'm excited to learn about promices and the fetch api now!

  I am going to re-make this library using more modern technologies: fetch with promices and es6 arrow functions.

  I just reviewed all of the asynchronous javascript technologies that I have been learning about this week and I feel like I am grasping them a lot better now. I am about to make a second version of a custom http library using es6 classes and arrow functions, as well as using fetch api and promices.

  I was able to do most of it without looking back at the tutorial that I am following. I forgot to put the method and content type in the delete method, I forgot a promise takes in resolve and reject, and I forgot where exactly to put the content type too. Other than that I remembered just about all of this! Making progress slowly and steadily!!!

  I am going to do a third version of this custom http request library using async and await keywords. I will try and convert it without looking it up first, then I will correct myself.
