Creating a custom library to make http requests using AJAX with callback functions

  I watched a whole tutorial about this and built a part of it and i'm honestly pretty lost as to how exactly this works. I get what it does and why I would use it but I need to see this a few more times I think to learn more about callbacks and AJAX..

  Ok, i'm about to go at this again. I'm going to take it from the top and try and go all the way through, i'm not opposed to doing it over and over untill I get it either so it probably wont be my last time doing this exercise.

  Alright, I just completed going over this again and I get it a lot more now. I'm excited to learn about promices and the fetch api now!
